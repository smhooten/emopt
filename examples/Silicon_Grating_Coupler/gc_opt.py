"""
This file demonstrates how to use EMOpt in order to simulate and optimize
more complicated silicon photonic structures.  In particular, we optimize a
partially-etched silicon grating coupler in order to maximize the coupling
efficiency between the grating coupler and an optical fiber.  The design paramters
of this grating coupler are the widths of the gaps (etched parts) of the grating,
the etch depth, and the burried oxide thickness.

The optimization process is broken into three pieces. First, the simulation of
the structure is setup. Next, an AdjointMethod class is created which defines
the a mapping between the design parameters of the system and the material
distributions of the system, the figure of merit, and the quantities needed to
compute the gradient of the figure of merit with respect to the design
parameters of the system. Finally, the optimization is run using the
emopt.optimizer.Optimizer class. In order to monitor the progress of the
optimization, we define an optional callback function which saves a plot of the
current state of the optimization after each iteration in the optimization.

When working through this example, you should first scroll to the bottom of the
file to main section, i.e.

    if __name__ == '__main__':

and read through how the simulation is setup.  Then, look over the
:class:`.SiliconGratingAM` class which demonstrates the core components of an
adjoint-method-based optimization.

Finally, to run the code, execute::

    mpirun -n 16 python gc_opt.py

in the command line which will run the optimization using 16 cores on the current
machine.
